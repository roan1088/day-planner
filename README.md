# Day Planner

As an assignment, I had to create a work day planner where user can store events for the day. I was provided a starter code of a webpage made from HTML and CSS with Bootstrap. I used JavaScript with JQuery to create HTML elements to display each hour and their agenda. I used the MomentJS library to work with date and time and color-code the hour blocks. I also used local storage to save agendas so that it is stored and the user can view later. 

## Link to deployed website:

## Usage

Follow the link to view the day planner for today. Click on the textarea to add a new task. Then click on the save button to save the agenda for that hour.

Note: The save button only saves for that hour. Make sure to save for every hour.
